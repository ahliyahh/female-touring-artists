# Tour Data Analysis

This project analyzes historical concert tour data to uncover trends in artist earnings and performance frequency. The goal was to clean the dataset and visualize insights that highlight top-grossing artists and the number of shows they performed.

## Overview

The analysis focuses on:
- Cleaning and preparing the raw tour dataset for analysis.
- Creating visualizations to summarize trends in gross earnings and performance frequency.
- Identifying the artists with the highest and lowest gross earnings as well as the most and least shows performed.

## Key Findings

After cleaning the data and generating two main visualizations:

- **Top Grossing Artist:** Taylor Swift  
- **Lowest Grossing Artist:** Cher  
- **Most Shows Performed:** Cher  
- **Least Shows Performed:** Taylor Swift  

These insights were derived using a **bar chart** to compare average gross revenue and number of shows across artists, making it easy to see performance trends at a glance.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values in numeric and categorical columns.
   - Ensured correct data types for analysis.
   - Removed any irrelevant or duplicated data points.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Calculated average gross revenue per artist.
   - Calculated average number of shows per artist.
   - Sorted results to identify top and bottom performers.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Used **Matplotlib** to create bar charts showing:
     - Average gross revenue by artist.
     - Average number of shows by artist.

## Tools & Libraries
